# Knapsack-problem-dynamic-programming
Very simple tool to generate with dynamic programming the table of the solution x* to the knapsack problem.
The code takes inspiration from the one exposed here: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/knapsack-problem/

To use the program just download and compile the file knapsack.c :D
